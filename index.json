However, the improved economy of PHEVs strongly depends on the control strategy that decides on the power distribution between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the electric battery. Traditional rule-based control strategies are no more practical considering the increasing and more complex control objectives introduced by the emerging technologies such as automated driving and connected vehicles. In this study, an advanced Energy Management Strategy (EMS) based on Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is developed. DDP solves a finite-horizon optimization problem given the driving cycle a priori to obtain a global optimal vehicle power distribution that contributes mostly to the fuel economy improvements. DDP results are used to benchmark the subsequent RL-developed algorithms‚Äô performance. In the newly proposed control strategy, an adaptive online learning RL agent is introduced into the existing Hybrid Control Unit (HCU) architecture solving the EMS for near-optimal solutions. The objective is to minimize the vehicle's expected total fuel consumption with a proper battery depletion rate besides penalizing the frequent engine on/off switching. Several RL-based algorithms have been experimented with using a vehicle model simulation. As a result, an Extended Deep Q-Network (E-DQN) agent is proposed by the thesis, trained on one cycle, and deployed on two other cycles to evaluate the performance. The thesis findings showed that E-DQN outperformed the rule-based strategy achieving up to 10.46% improvement in fuel economy closer to the DP performance alongside providing adequate compliance with the vehicle drivability and driver com-fort objectives.","tags":["Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","Energy Management Strategy","Deterministic Dynamic Programming","Reinforcement Learning","Machine learning","Deep Neural Networks","Model-based RL"],"title":"AI-based Energy Management Strategies for P2 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amr Mousa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"13f3331a4261bb8a554cd27840c8da6f","permalink":"https://amrmousa.com/publication/thesis/asu_meng/","publishdate":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/asu_meng/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Process design and implementation of an automated document issuance system for academic purposes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amr Mousa","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In response to AIAA aircraft design competition (undergraduate-team category) ‚ÄúHybrid-Electric General Aviation (HEGAA) 2018‚Äù, hyBIRD aircraft family is presented in this design report. hyBIRD is a team of four undergraduate students from the University of Science and Technology at Zewail City, Egypt. The team worked on designing a family of aircraft for an entry in service (EIS) in 2028 for the 4-seater aircraft and 2030 for the 6-seater based on the future technology. This required forecasting the technology trends for the powertrain components and studying the similar airplanes market, in the same category, which helped identifying our competitive edge and selling point. Advanced design approaches were performed throughout the whole design process such as Integrated Reconfigurable Matrix of Alternatives (IRMA) for aircraft configuration selection, powertrain sizing optimization, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and composites FEA analysis. hyBIRD aircraft is an all-composite airframe with serial hybrid propulsion system utilizing a turbo-normalized piston engine, a frontal electric motor and two smaller motors on the wing-tips. A tadpole-shaped fuselage with low-wing and V-tail was selected. Both airplanes are identical except for the flight controller, motors and batteries which results in an 83% part-commonality by weight and this can help achieve minimal development, certification, and manufacturing costs. Based on the aircraft weight, complexity, and performance, the Eastlake cost model estimates the aircraft to be highly competitively to various aircraft of similar performance in terms of initial and operational costs.","tags":"","title":"hyBIRD: Design of a Four and Six Seater Hybrid-Electric Aircraft Family","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
